#' Convert raw score to scale score and vice versa
#'
#' @param ip An \code{\link{Itempool-class}} object.
#' @param raw_score A value (or vector of values) representing raw score(s).
#' @param scale_score A value (or vector of values) representing scale score(s).
#' @param theta_range The limits of the scale score. The default is
#'   \code{c(-5, 5)}.
#' @param tolerance A numeric value representing the tolerance level for the
#'   uniroot function. The default is \code{1e-6}. This value is used to
#'   determine the convergence of the uniroot function. A smaller value will
#'   result in a more accurate result, but will take longer to compute. The

#' Calculate summed-score probabilities
#'
#' @description This function calculates all summed-score probabilities
#'   of a given theta value(s) using recursive algorithm described in
#'   Thissen, Pommerich, Billeaud and Williams (1995). This function is the
#'   extension of the recursive algorithm proposed by Lord and Wingersky (1984)
#'   to polytomous items.
#'
#' @param ip An \code{\link{Itempool-class}} object. Item pool parameters can
#'   be composed of any combination of unidimensional dichotomous or polytomous
#'   items.
#' @param theta A numeric vector representing the theta values at which the sum
#'   score probabilities will be calculated.
#' @param theta_pdf A numeric vector with the same length of \code{theta}
#'   argument representing the density values of each theta value. The
#'   resulting probabilities will be weighted by these values. The default
#'   value is \code{NULL} where the resulting probabilities will not be
#'   weighted.
#'
#' @return A matrix containing the probabilities of each possible sum score.
#'   Each row represent a sum score and each column represent the theta value
#'   provided by \code{theta} argument.
